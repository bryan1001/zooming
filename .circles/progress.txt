## Codebase Patterns
- Canvas element is in index.html with id="canvas"
- Three.js scene, camera, and renderer are initialized in src/main.ts
- Styles go in src/style.css with fullscreen canvas setup
- Use MeshStandardMaterial for objects that need lighting
- City-related modules go in src/city/ directory
- Use seeded random (mulberry32) for reproducible procedural generation
- Run `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript passes
- CHUNK_SIZE is 200 units (exported from chunk.ts), use for chunk management calculations

## 2026-02-02 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Initialized Vite + TypeScript project
  - Installed Three.js and @types/three
  - Created index.html with canvas element
  - Created main.ts with basic Three.js scene (rotating cube, lighting)
  - Configured fullscreen canvas styling
- Files changed:
  - index.html (canvas element)
  - src/main.ts (Three.js scene setup)
  - src/style.css (fullscreen canvas styles)
  - package.json (added three, @types/three)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vite uses vanilla-ts template for TypeScript projects
  - Three.js requires both three and @types/three packages
  - Canvas needs display:block to prevent scrollbars
  - MeshStandardMaterial requires lighting to be visible
  - Run `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript (script added to package.json)

## 2026-02-02 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Created src/city/building.ts module with createBuilding function
  - Buildings use seeded random number generator for reproducible randomness
  - Building dimensions: height 10-100 units, width/depth 5-20 units
  - Buildings positioned with base at y=0
  - Added typecheck script to package.json
- Files changed:
  - src/city/building.ts (new file - building generator)
  - package.json (added typecheck script)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use seeded random (mulberry32) for reproducible procedural generation
  - Position meshes by setting y to half the height for floor-aligned objects
  - City-related modules go in src/city/ directory

## 2026-02-02 - US-003
- What was implemented:
  - Created src/city/chunk.ts module with createChunk function
  - Chunk is a 200x200 unit area (CHUNK_SIZE constant exported)
  - Buildings placed in a grid pattern with 25-unit blocks (provides street gaps)
  - Uses hashPosition() for reproducible building seeds based on world coordinates
  - Chunk stores its coordinates in userData for identification
- Files changed:
  - src/city/chunk.ts (new file - chunk generator)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CHUNK_SIZE is 200 units, exported for use by other modules
  - Block size of 25 units provides room for buildings (5-20 units) plus street gaps
  - Use hashPosition() pattern to generate unique seeds from world coordinates
  - Store chunk identification in Group.userData for later management
  - Grid layout: blocksPerSide = floor(CHUNK_SIZE / BLOCK_SIZE) = 8 buildings per axis
