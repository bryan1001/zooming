## Codebase Patterns
- Canvas element is in index.html with id="canvas"
- Three.js scene, camera, and renderer are initialized in src/main.ts
- Styles go in src/style.css with fullscreen canvas setup
- Use MeshStandardMaterial for objects that need lighting

## 2026-02-02 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Initialized Vite + TypeScript project
  - Installed Three.js and @types/three
  - Created index.html with canvas element
  - Created main.ts with basic Three.js scene (rotating cube, lighting)
  - Configured fullscreen canvas styling
- Files changed:
  - index.html (canvas element)
  - src/main.ts (Three.js scene setup)
  - src/style.css (fullscreen canvas styles)
  - package.json (added three, @types/three)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vite uses vanilla-ts template for TypeScript projects
  - Three.js requires both three and @types/three packages
  - Canvas needs display:block to prevent scrollbars
  - MeshStandardMaterial requires lighting to be visible
